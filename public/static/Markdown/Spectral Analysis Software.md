Raman spectroscopy uses scattered light to analyze molecular vibrations, providing information on chemical composition and molecular structure.

The experimental data has intensity vs wavelength. The raw data needs to be pre-processed to remove noise, baseline correction, and normalizes spectra for accurate analysis

The app has a React frontend that takes input data and let user select the preprocessing steps and parameters. 
A python backend written using flask and scipy hosted on Google cloud app engine , processes the data.
Plotly.js is used to plot and visualize data through out the process.
