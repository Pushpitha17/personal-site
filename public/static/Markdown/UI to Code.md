This was done as an attempt to brush up raw css skills. The figma mockup was created by a  friend as a personal project.  

The project was done using Html , CSS and Vanilla Js. It also uses bootstrap mainly for itâ€™s grid system.

For those who are curious, the link leads to the portfolio of my talented friend who did the UI.
