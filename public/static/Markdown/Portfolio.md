This Portfolio was built mainly to showcase the software projects i've done over the years. 

I built this using Next.Js 13 using server rendered components. This text you see is rendered using markdown files. I've mapped markdown and images using JSON files to render data. 

I used tailwind css for styling. The site renders your prefered color theme seamlessly. Implementing it , was a bit of a hassle with the server rendered components. 

I plan on to use this site as my corner of the internet to share things about life in general.
